A virtue must be <em>our</em> invention; it must spring out of <em>our</em> personal need and defence. In every other case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life <em>menaces</em> it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of “virtue,” as Kant would have it, is pernicious. “Virtue,” “duty,” “good for its own sake,” goodness grounded upon impersonality or a notion of universal validity—these are all chimeras, and in them one finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the Chinese spirit of Königsberg.</p></div> </div>
