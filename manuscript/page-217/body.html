<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Everything that is well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul’s priceless saying: “And God hath chosen the <em>weak</em> things of the world, the <em>foolish</em> things of the world, the <em>base</em> things of the world, and things which are <em>despised_”: _this</em> was the formula; <em>in hoc signo</em> the <em>décadence</em> triumphed.—<em>God on the cross_—is man always to miss the frightful inner significance of this symbol?—Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross, is _divine</em>.... We all hang on the cross, consequently <em>we</em> are divine.... We alone are divine.... Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed by it—Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of humanity.—</p><p>The word <em>training</em> is in English in the text.</p><p>1 Corinthians i, 27, 28.</p></div> </div>
