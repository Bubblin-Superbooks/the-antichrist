Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every “impersonal” duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.—To think that no one has thought of Kant’s categorical imperative as <em>dangerous to life</em>!... The theological instinct alone took it under protection!—An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a <em>right</em> action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as an <em>objection</em>....

That is the recipe for <em>décadence</em>,</p></div> </div>
