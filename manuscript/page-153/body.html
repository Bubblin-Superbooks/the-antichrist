<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>34.</h3><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he regarded only <em>subjective</em> realities as realities, as “truths”—that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The concept of “the Son of God” does not connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but an “eternal” fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing is true, and in the highest sense, of the <em>God</em> of this typical symbolist, of the “kingdom of God,” and of the “sonship of God.”</p></div> </div>
