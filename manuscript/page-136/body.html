<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank <em>in psychologicus</em>, has contributed the two most <em>unseemly</em> notions to this business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the <em>genius</em> and that of the <em>hero</em> (“<em>héros_”). But if there is anything essentially unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here converted into something moral: (“resist not evil!”—the most profound sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the _inability</em> to be an enemy. What is the meaning of “glad tidings”?—The true life, the life eternal has been found—it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in <em>you</em>; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions, from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God—Jesus claims nothing for himself</p></div> </div>
