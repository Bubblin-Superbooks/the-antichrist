<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>7.</h3><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">Christianity is called the religion of <em>pity</em>.—Pity stands in opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and living energy—a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the cause (—the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the first view of it; there is, however, a still more important one.</p></div> </div>
